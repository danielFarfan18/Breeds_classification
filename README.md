# Breeds_classification
Description:
This project involves using a pre-developed image classifier to identify dog breeds for a citywide dog show. The classifier ensures that only images of actual dogs are registered.

Key Tasks:

Evaluate various image classification algorithms to determine which one most accurately distinguishes between dogs and non-dogs.
Assess the performance of the best algorithm in correctly identifying specific dog breeds.
Measure the runtime of each algorithm, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency.
Technical Details:

Utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet architectures, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
Applied a provided classifier function to classify images, ensuring accurate breed identification, even for breeds with similar appearances.
